# Angular Lab 3

## Instructions

In the last lab, you put together a page that displayed a list of Athletes that
tracked the following athlete properties:

1. Name
2. What sport they played
3. Whether they were currently active

Extend that page to give the user the ability to not only see your initial list,
but also to add to it and see the new values they have added on the existing
list.

Hint: use the same breakdown steps as we used in the previous section and adjust
your data structure to reflect the specific information you're dealing with in
this lab.
